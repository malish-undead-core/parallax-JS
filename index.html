                    <h2>1. Mount Everest is the World’s Highest Mountain</h2>
                    <p>
                        Mount Everest has the “highest elevation above the sea level,” which is why it is called the
                        highest point on Earth. The
                        mountain’s epic height was first identified in 1856 by a team escorted by a British surveyor –
                        Sir George Everest. The
                        official height of Everest is calculated to be 8,848 meters (29,028 feet).
                        Did you know that six people on average die annually while climbing Mount Everest? That’s just a
                        bonus fact for you.

                    <h2>3. K-2 Is Also Known as the Savage Mountain</h2>
                    <p>
                        K-2 is the world’s second-highest mountain in the world, situated on the China-Pakistan border.
                        It was named “the Savage
                        Mountain” after George Bell (an American explorer) climbed the mountain in 1953 and said, “It’s
                        a savage mountain that
                        tries to kill you.”
                        Of all the highest mountains in the world, K-2 is indeed the deadliest.

                    <h2>4. New Zealand Features the World’s Longest Mountain Name</h2>
                    <p>
                        The name holds the Guinness World Record and consists of 85 characters. The name of this
                        mountain is
                        Taumatawhakatangihangakoauauotamateapokaiwhenuakitanatahu. When translated into English, the
                        word means “the place where
                        Tmatea, the man with the big knees, who slid, climbed, and swallowed mountains, known as –
                        landeater – played his nose
                        flute to his loved one”.

                    <h2>5. Mountain Goats are Adept to Climbing Mountains</h2>
                    <p>
                        Also known as the Rocky Mountain goat, this mammal is indigenous to North America. Mountain
                        goats have cloven hooves and
                        toes that enable them to cover wide steps. Plus, the bottom of each toe has a hard pad that
                        gives them a solid grip.
                        It is believed that mountain goats can climb mountains better than even the most skilled human
                        mountaineers.

                    <h2>6. Mountains Exist Under the Sea as Well</h2>
                    <p>
                        There are enormous mountains underwater. The most famous undersea mountain is the Mid-Atlantic
                        Ridge while the highest
                        ocean mountain is Mount Vema in the South Atlantic Ocean.

                        Undersea mountains were formed as a result of volcanic activity under the sea. After these
                        volcanic eruptions were over,
                        the mountains (which were first above land) were submerged in the oceans. Most of these
                        mountains carry a lot of
                        nutrients and prove to be a rich source of food for various sea creatures.
                    </p>
                    <h2>7. Mountains Also Grow Plants</h2>
                    <p>
                        While mountains may seem barren, they actually boast a wide variety of plants and trees. These
                        include shrubs, grasses,
                        mosses, lichens, and alpine flowers.
                        Some mountains also feature evergreen trees such as pines, cedars, and spruce trees. However,
                        nothing grows on mountains
                        above the snow line. This part of the mountain is effectively a desert.

                    <h2>8. 12% of the World’s People Live in the Mountains</h2>
                    <p>
                        In addition to plants and animals, people are also well-adapted to living in the mountains.
                        Mountains offer fresh air
                        and scenic beauty to their inhabitants.
                        An amazing thing about these people is that people living in the mountains tend to enjoy a
                        longer lifespan.
                        These were just some amazing facts about mountains. These natural formations are larger than
                        life, and some of the
                        Earth’s most amazing constructions!
